## 🧠 About

**OntoExhibit** is a comprehensive ontology designed to accurately and extensively model the **art exhibition domain**.  
It captures the **complexity, multidimensionality, and richness** of exhibitions as cultural phenomena, providing a semantic framework that enables:

- Structured representation of exhibitions
- Coherent linking of heterogeneous information
- Advanced semantic querying and knowledge discovery

OntoExhibit is implemented in **OWL 2 (Web Ontology Language)** and supports the adoption of **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) in cultural data management.

## 📄 Abstract

OntoExhibit consists of an OWL 2 ontology designed to facilitate the adoption of FAIR principles in managing information associated with the art exhibition domain. It aims to guarantee standardization, interoperability, reusability, and the extraction of new and strategic knowledge within this cultural sector.

The ontology addresses the needs of a wide range of stakeholders, including art historians, curators, cultural heritage professionals, galleries, and creative and cultural industries, by offering a structured and semantically rich representation of exhibitions as complex cultural ecosystems.

---

## 📚 Introduction

OntoExhibit is conceived as a comprehensive ontology designed to address the needs of multiple target scenarios:

1. Art historians and researchers engaged in exhibition and curatorial studies  
2. Cultural heritage professionals documenting art exhibitions  
3. Museum and independent curators  
4. Gallery owners  
5. Creative and cultural industries (CCI) and tourism stakeholders  

OntoExhibit originates from the conceptual model underlying **Expofinder**, a relational database developed within the *Exhibitium* project (Rodríguez-Ortega & Cruces-Rodríguez, 2019). While Expofinder followed a traditional relational approach to exhibitions—conceived as networks of relationships among actors and cultural objects—OntoExhibit extends and transforms this model through a refined semantic and conceptual framework.

This development was informed by extensive dialogue with researchers, curators, gallery owners, and art critics, allowing OntoExhibit to reinterpret the art exhibition domain as a **complex cultural ecosystem** composed of human and non-human actors intertwined through social, discursive, and symbolic practices.

OntoExhibit approaches exhibitions in their dual condition:
- As discursive, social, and cultural productions emerging from practices and interactions
- As active generators of discourse and public spheres, influencing future exhibitions and cultural meaning

## 🧩 OntoExhibit Overview

OntoExhibit is aligned with reference ontologies, particularly:

- **CIDOC-CRM (v7.2.1)**
- **FRBRoo (v3.0)**

Selected classes and properties from these ontologies have informed OntoExhibit’s structure, while **new classes and properties** have been created to respond specifically to the requirements of the art exhibition domain.

OntoExhibit is **not a CIDOC-CRM specification**, but rather an ontology that adopts and aligns with key entities where appropriate, while proposing a conceptual structure better suited to modelling exhibitions as complex cultural ecosystems.
